Project Title:
CSC 1300-001 Programming Assignment 2: Standard Math Program


Description:
The program will ask the user to input a positive integer, and then it will perform a set of mathematical tasks. 
Given the positive integer input (e.g., n), the program will (1) compute the sum of 1 to n, (2) compute the factorial value of n, 
(3) display the times table of n in a certain way, (4) check whether n is even or odd, (5) check whether or not n is a prime number, and 
(6) check whether or not n is an Armstrong number.It is expected the program will continue the aforementioned operations for every 
positive integer; however, if and only if the user inputs 0, then the program should terminate itself. If the user inputs a negative number, 
then your program should not perform the aforementioned operations and ask the user to input a positive number instead to perform the tasks.
